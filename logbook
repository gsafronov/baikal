Start development of timing calibrtation based on reconstructed muons (Fedor, Bair).
The following calibration algorithm should be used for particular channel:

1). Exclude channel from reconstruction.

2). Process full dataset and reconstruct muon tracks.

3). Select subset of tracks propagating in the vicinity of the given channel. This can be done by applying cut on distance from channel to track.

4). Extrapolate the time of hit from timing of hit in each of channels used in the reconstruction. Obtain average. Or use reconstructed timing of track (if exists).

5). Obtain actual timing of hit in the given channel. Calculate difference to extrapolated time. Obtain distribution of difference for the whole set of selected tracks.

6). Calculate the correction.
